# Uprev_Grafana_Logging

## Overview
This project aims to provide analysis of log files generated by the UpRev (https://www.uprev.com) tuning software, commonly used by Nissan performance enthusiests. The analysis is performed by loading CSV log data into InfluxDB which is then graphically represented in Grafana.  
  
The project is owner developed so don't expect a commercial level of polish here ðŸ¤“ As of this writing (Jan 4th 2023) its still under development to support my own VQ37 swapped E46 BMW project.

## Requirements
You will need the below software to run and make use of this, for referance it was developed on a M1 Mac. Please search out how to install the required software for your specific operating system.
  
- Docker and Docker Compose (https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Ruby (https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)
- Ruby gem 'influxdb-client' (performed once Ruby is operational ```gem install influxdb-client -v 2.9.0```)

## Installation
- Ensure you have the above prerequisite installs taken care of
- Clone this repository to some place sensible on your computer
- Ensure you are in the directory where the repo content is, and execute ```docker compose up```. This should download a bunch of content and leave you with a screen full of log output. This will stay running interactively like this until you exit it via CTRL-C or CMD-C etc.
- Validate you are able to access Grafana by going to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser. You should be promoted to login and the credentials are in the boxes already as hints.
- Load in the sample data provided by executing the provided script. Again this is done from inside the cloned directory and will take a short time.  
```./play_uprev_log.rb log_files/sample.csv```
- Go back to Grafana in your browser and refresh ... you should now see some sample data populated. Ensure the time picker is set to the last 30 or 60 minutes say.
- Get familiar with how to look at the data and have a play !!! https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/use-dashboards/
